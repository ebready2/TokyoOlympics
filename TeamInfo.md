## Project Summary

Our project uses the 2021 tokyo olympics dataset from Kaggle to create a multi-paged user-friendly website. The first page creates data visualizations for various categories that the user may be interested in searching. Examples include medal count per country, winners in particular sports, a particular athlete’s performance, the members of a country’s team, the number athletes per country, the number of athletes per discipline, the distribution of gender on sport, etc. The second page is a “what-if table” in which the user can edit the person’s ranking to see how it changes other variables – such as their country’s ranking – and use Matlab and Google Cloud platform to visualize real-time changes in data.
